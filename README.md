# AI-Projects
This project demonstrates a simple text summarizer built using pre-trained Transformer models from Hugging Face. It takes a paragraph as input and generates a concise summary.  The goal was to explore Generative AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and understand how large language models process and generate human-like text.
