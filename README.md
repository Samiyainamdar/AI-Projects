# AI-Projects
This project demonstrates a simple text summarizer built using pre-trained Transformer models from Hugging Face. It takes a paragraph as input and generates a concise summary.  The goal was to explore Generative AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and understand how large language models process and generate human-like text.

What I Learned:

Understood how transformer-based models like BART perform abstractive summarization — rewriting text, not just extracting sentences.
To use Hugging Face’s pipeline API for quick and effective model usage.
Observed how parameters like max_length and min_length control the summary’s detail.
Gained hands-on experience with Generative AI for a practical NLP application.

Future Enhancements :

This project can be improved in the following ways:

Interactive App: Add a Streamlit or Gradio UI to make summarization user-friendly.
Adjustable Summary Length: Allow users to control summary detail level.
Multilingual Support: Add models for Hindi or multilingual summarization.
Document Summarization: Extend to summarize PDFs, news articles, or research papers.
